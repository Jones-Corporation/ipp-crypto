## CMake Build Options

### Common for all operating systems

- `-B<build-dir>` - defines the build directory. This is the directory where CMake puts the generated Microsoft Visual Studio\* solution or makefiles.

- `-DARCH=<ia32|intel64>` - on Linux* OS and macOS*, defines the target architecture for the build of the Intel IPP Cryptography library.
    > **NOTE:** On Windows* OS, use `-G`/`-A`  instead. See the description of these options [below](#windows-os-1).

    > **NOTE:** Due to the significant shift in the industry towards 64-bit architecture, the support of 32-bit libraries is deprecated in the Intel IPP Cryptography 2021.9 release and targeted to be removed after one year deprecation notice period.

- `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Defines the configuration of the Intel IPP Cryptography library to build:

  - `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=on`: default configuration. It includes the following steps:
    - Build of a dispatched static library with all available optimizations
    - Build of a dispatched dynamic library with all available optimizations
    - Generation of the single-CPU headers (for details, refer to [this](./OVERVIEW.md) section)

  - `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off`: build of one static library per optimization; build of one dynamic library per optimization.

- `-DPLATFORM_LIST="<platform list>"` - optional, works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set. Sets target platforms for the code to be compiled. See the supported platforms list [here](./OVERVIEW.md).

    - Example for Linux\* OS and the IA-32 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="w7;s8;p8;g9;h9"`

    - Example for Linux\* OS and the Intel® 64 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="m7;n8;y8;e9;l9;k0;k1"`
- `-DNO_CRYPTO_MB:BOOL=TRUE` - optional, turns off the build of [Crypto Multi Buffer library](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md) and, as a consequence, removes all dependencies on OpenSSL library.
- `-DBABASSL:BOOL=on`, `-DBORINGSSL:BOOL=on` - required only if forks of OpenSSL library are used to resolve OpenSSL dependencies - Tongsuo and BoringSSL respectively. These flags make sense when [Crypto Multi Buffer library](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md) is built.
- `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="<CPU features list>"` - optional, works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set, i.e. only for 1CPU libraries. Enables the CPU feature dispatching mask at compile-time based on the provided list.

   - Currently supported by the library custom features dispatching:
        1. Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) code-path enabling: `IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON`
        2. Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) / Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2) vector extensions of Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) code-paths enabling: `IPPCP_VAES_ON;IPPCP_VCLMUL_ON`.
    - Example:
        `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON"` - this combination enables Intel® AES-NI in all 1CPU libraries, which contains this code path.
    - Example of using a combination of CPU features:
        `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON;IPPCP_VAES_ON;IPPCP_VCLMUL_ON"` - in this combination the highest available feature in each 1CPU library will be enabled (e.g. for `"y8"` it’s Intel® AES-NI, for `"l9"` it's Intel® AVX2 VAES, and for `"k1"` - Intel® AVX-512 VAES)
- `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Regulates the build of FIPS-compliant Intel IPP Cryptography library.

  - `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`: enables all FIPS-compliance changes in Intel IPP Cryptography library.
  - `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Intel IPP Cryptography library build with such option is not FIPS-compliant.
- `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Enables internal memory allocation and release using `malloc()` and `free()` functions inside Intel IPP Cryptography library selftests.
  - `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=on`: memory management is held by FIPS selftests, all processing APIs should be called with input parameters equal to `NULL`.
  - `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Memory management is held by customer's application, all processing APIs should be called with work buffers of the valid length.
- `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Regulates the build of FIPS-compliant  Crypto Multi-buffer Library.

  - `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`: enables all FIPS-compliance changes in Crypto Multi-buffer Library.
  - `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Crypto Multi-buffer Library build with such option is not FIPS-compliant.

- `-DFIPS_CUSTOM_IPPCP_API_HEADER=<redefined_ippcp_api.h>` - optional flag which allows to use FIPS self-tests with IPPCP API with a different prefix to support capabilities of the custom dispatcher generated by Custom Library Tool (Please, note that it is only intended for a very specific use case of [Custom Library](./OVERVIEW.md/#static-library-with-custom-functionality)).The header should contain redefinitions of IPPCP public API, e.g. `#define ippcpGetLibVersion custom_prefix_ippcpGetLibVersion`. The flag is applicable only when IPPCP FIPS mode is enabled (`-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`).

### Windows\* OS

- `-G"<tool-chain-generator>"` - defines the native build system CMake will generate from the input files.
  Refer to CMake [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators) for the Visual Studio\* generators options.

- `-A<x64|Win32>` - for Visual Studio\* 2019+, defines the target architecture for the build of the Intel IPP Cryptography library.

- `-T<Compiler>` - defines the compiler for building.
  For example, to use Intel® Compiler, specify `-T"Intel C++ Compiler 19.1"`.

> **NOTE:** Refer to CMake [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html) for more information on these options.

### Linux\* OS

- `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=<off|on>` - optional. Defines whether the built library is position-dependent or not.

  - `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=off:` default. Position-independent code.

  - `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=on:` position-dependent code.

## Incorporating Intel® IPP Cryptography sources into custom build system

You can include Intel IPP Cryptography sources into some arbitrary project's CMake build system and build them with it.

Here is the minimal working example:

``` bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

project("test_proj")

# `crypto` is the repository root folder of Intel IPP Cryptography
add_subdirectory(crypto)
include_directories(crypto/include)

# 'main.cpp' is some arbitrary project's source file
add_executable("test_proj" main.cpp)
# `ippcp_s` is the target name of static library in the Intel IPP Cryptography build system.
# This static library will be built automatically, when you build your project.
target_link_libraries("test_proj" "ippcp_s")
```

Also you can use CMake module to find the Intel IPP Cryptography library installed on the system. The module location is `examples/FindIPPCrypto.cmake` and here is the example of its usage:

``` bash
find_package(IPPCrypto REQUIRED MODULE)

if (NOT IPPCRYPTO_FOUND)
   message(FATAL_ERROR "No Intel IPP Cryptography library found on the system.")
endif()

# If Intel IPP Cryptography is found, the following variables will be defined:
#     `IPPCRYPTO_LIBRARIES` - static library name
#     `IPPCRYPTO_INCLUDE_DIRS` - path to Intel IPP Cryptography headers
#     `IPPCRYPTO_ROOT_DIR` - library root dir (a folder with 'include' and 'lib' directories)
```
